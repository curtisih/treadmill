This project documents a replacement controller design for a Reebok DMXPLUS treadmill.  It didn’t take very long for the treadmill console to stop working.  From the manual it seems they are really sensitive to power line spikes.  Regardless on why it dies I don’t want to pay a ton of money for a new console or treadmill.  I figured it would be more fun and (maybe) cheaper to just use a Raspberry Pi and some support electronics to control the main motor, elevation motor and whatever else  I find.
